#A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, 
# then zero or more for or if clauses. The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression
#  in the context of the for and if clauses which follow it. For example, this listcomp combines the elements
#  of two lists if they are not equal:


print([(x, y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4] if x != y])
print([(x, y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4]])


#and itâ€™s equivalent to:

combs = []
for x in [1,2,3]:
    for y in [3,1,4]:
        if x != y:
            combs.append((x, y))

#Del 
#There is a way to remove an item from a list given its index instead of its value: the del statement. This differs from the pop() method which returns a value. The del statement can also be used to remove slices from a list or clear the entire list (which we did earlier by assignment of an empty list to the slice). For example:

a = [-1, 1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5]
del a[0]
print(a)
print(a[2:4])
del a[2:4]
print(a)

del a[:]

# Tuples are immutable:
#t[0] = 88888

# but they can contain mutable objects:
v = ([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])
print(v)
